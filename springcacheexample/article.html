<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>One of the new features in Spring 3.1 is cache abstraction that allows developers to easily cache method results.
With the release of Spring 3.1.0 milestone 1, developers can try this new feature out.  This blog article provides
a simple Maven project that demonstrates how to use the new cache annotations.</p>

<h3>Why Cache?</h3>
<p>Some data access methods or business methods return the same object or collection of objects given the same values
for method parameters.  So executing the method 20 times for the same method parameter values is wasteful.  For a 
method that executes a long-running process caching the method's result can be a useful time saver. 
Most object relational frameworks provide support to cache results. </p>

<h3>Spring Cache Support</h3> 
<p>In Spring 3.1, developers can use new cache annotations provided by the Spring framework to cache method results.  
These cache annotations work similar to how Spring provides transaction support.  You annotate the method whose result 
you want to cache with the @Cacheable annotation.  If you want to remove all or some cache entries when a given method
is executed, you can annotate that method with @CacheEvict.</p>

<h3>Example Application</h3>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.brucephillips.name/spring/springcacheexample.zip">download a zipped archive of 
a simple Maven project</a>
 that demonstrates using the @Cacheable and @CacheEvict annotations.  </p>
 
 <p>After downloading the example application, you can import it into Eclipse. If you don't use Eclipse, 
 you can unzip the download and import the Maven project into any Maven aware Java IDE.</p>

<h3>Spring @Cacheable And @CacheEvict</h3>
<p>Examine the PersonDaoStub class, getPerson method:</p>

<code>

	@Cacheable("persons")
	public Person getPerson(Long personId) {

	...
	
	}
	
</code>

<p>The method getPerson is annotated with @Cacheable("persons").  This annotation will cause Spring to create a 
cache of Person objects returned by this method (the cache will be named persons).  The first time the method is
called with a value of 123L, the method will execute and the Person object returned will be added to the persons
cache.  The next time the getPerson method is called with a value of 123L, the Person object in the cache with 
that personId value will be returned and the method will not actually execute.</p>

<p>Examine the PersonDaoStub class, loadPeople method:</p>

<code>

    @CacheEvict(value="persons", allEntries=true)
	public void loadPeople() {
	
	...
	
	}

</code>

<p>The loadPeople method is annotated with the @CacheEvict annotation.  When this method is called, all the 
Person objects stored in the persons cache will be removed.  The next time method getPerson is called it will
execute completely.</p>

<h3>Testing Spring Cache Implementation</h3>
<p>In src/test/java is a JUnit test for method getPerson that demonstrates that getPerson only executes once no 
matter how many times it is called.
To run the application's JUnit test open a terminal (command) window and navigate to the project's root folder. 
Then at the command line run mvn -e clean test. The test calls getPerson 20 times, then calls loadPeople, 
and then calls getPerson 20 more times.  In the console output you should see these log messages:</p>

<code>

Running name.brucephillips.springcacheexample.dao.PersonDaoTest
Method getPerson has executed 1 time(s).
Method loadPeople has executed.
 Method getPerson has executed 2 time(s).
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.079 sec

</code>

<p>If you want to see what happens when the cache annotations are not present, 
comment out the @Cacheable and @CacheEvict annotations in class PersonDaoStub
and save the class source file.
Then rerun the test (mvn -e clean test).</p>

<h3>Cache Storage Providers</h3>
<p>Spring provides support for two cache storage providers: ConcurrentHashMap and Ehcache.  The example's Spring 
configuration file for the test (src/test/resources/name/brucephillips/springcacheexample/dao/PersonDaoTest-context.xml)
 shows 
how to setup each of these.</p>
<p> Using ConcurrentHashMap is simpler to setup, but using Ehcache is more powerful.  Note that
reference 1's example code for setting up the Ehcache manager has a typo:  the property for referencing the 
cache-manager should be cache-manager-ref and not cache-manager.  Thanks to James Carr's blog article (reference 2) 
I was able to figure that out and fix an error I was getting when using cache-manager as the property name.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Spring's cache annotations provide developers a useful tool to use when needing to cache method results.  These 
new annotations will be especially handy when not using an object relational framework or when needing to cache 
the result from a long-running business method.</p>
