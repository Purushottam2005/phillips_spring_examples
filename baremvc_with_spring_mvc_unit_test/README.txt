This project is an example of how to do integration testing 
of a Spring MVC project by using the new MockMvc class
provided in Spring 3.2.

This project is initially based on the Simple-Spring-Web-Application
project provided by J. Verstry on GitHub at 
https://github.com/JVerstry/Web-Related-Examples.

I added to this project JUnit tests that demonstrate how to 
test the Spring MVC controller class HomeController.java.

The new code is in src/test/resources and src/test/java.
